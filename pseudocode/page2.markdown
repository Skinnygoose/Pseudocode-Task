It is important to note that the logic must be broken down to the level of a single loop or decision. Thus, "Search the list and find the customer with the highest balance" is too unclear because it necessitates the usage of both a loop and a nested decision. If there is a predefined function for it, such as String.indexOf(), using "Find" or "Lookup" is acceptable.
Each textbook and each designer may have their own particular pseudocode style. Pseudocode is not a strict notation because it is read by humans rather than computers. There is no common "standard" for the industry, however it is beneficial for educational purposes if we all use a comparable style. The following format is suggested for conveying your solutions in our lesson.
The "structured" part of pseudocode is a notation for representing six specific structured programming constructs: SEQUENCE, WHILE, IF-THEN-ELSE, REPEAT-UNTIL, FOR, and CASE. Each of these constructs can be embedded inside any other construct. These constructs represent the logic, or flow of control in an algorithm.
